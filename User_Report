We had a number of users play our game and several of them caught bugs. James Hampton discovered that if you exit a Pawn promotion window, the program crashed. Bryce Brown also found an error with undoing enpassant (it was not correctly undone, then undoing further crashed the program) and he also spotted an error with the variant in which captured pieces return to the start. If a piece was on the start square of another piece, and the other piece was captured, the first piece would be lost forever. This was also a way to capture the king, but the game wouldn’t end.  John Charles Bauschatz noticed that if each team is allowed more than one move per turn, the king could place himself in check. We were able to fix all of these problems.

Some of them had suggestions for improvement as well; James suggested moving the undo button from the file menu to a button on the game itself, which we did. John Charles and Tim had a suggestion for the Playback menu; they requested a list of Moves so that the user could jump directly to a certain move.  We are planning on implementing this in early phase 3, but didn’t have time in this phase to implement it. This should be fairly easy to do - one simple way of doing this would be to have buttons with the next several moves listed in ACN. Lily Briggs requested the ability to drop pieces (which we have already planned on implementing early in phase 3), and the ability to promote pieces other than pawns. This is another feature we were already planning on adding, and though we have not finished adding this yet, we’ve written our Rules class to be more extensible to this using the Promote and GetPromotionSquares classes.
