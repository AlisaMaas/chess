### Getting the Code
* First things first: Install and set up [SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/index.html)
 * Choose non-commercial use when the installer asks
 * The installer should automatically detect the location of your git executable _(Of course, this means if you don't have git installed, you need to go do that first)_
 * Tell the installer that your hosting provider is github and log in with your credentials
* Next, come back to github and Fork your own copy of the [chess repository](https://github.com/drewhannay/chess)
* Back in SmartGit, choose Clone and put in the URL of your forked copy of chess
 * Choose where to save your local code, then give the project a name in SmartGit and hit Finish

### Running the Code
* Download and set up [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-classic-372/indigosr2)
* In Eclipse, click New Java Project, then give the project a name and uncheck the "Use Default Location" checkbox and choose the location of your local copy of the code.
* You should now be able to run the project just by choosing "Run" in Eclipse!
